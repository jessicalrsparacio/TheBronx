# Welcome to The Bronx

> The Bronx. Though it may be the second-to-the-smallest borough of NYC's five, the Bronx is still home to some of NYC's most diverse communities and attractions. 


## **_Our Project_**

The aim of our project was to explore Airbnb data in the Bronx, to better understand the nature of short-term rentals in NYC. We planned to compare the Airbnb statistics in our Borough with the statistics in all Airbnb's across NYC, as well as more specifically explore four specific neighborhoods. 

We prepared three separate data-frames that we were going to compare throughout our project. Our first dataframe `airbnb` is the original dataset of all airbnb data for all four boroughs. Using `groupby`, we created two more sets, `bronx`, which contained the data just for all the neighborhoods in the bronx, and `my_bronx`, which contained all of the datafor our four
specific Bronx neighborhoods. 

### Price Matters!

We decided as a group that the information about price was the most relevant when discussing airbnbs, so we wanted to approach our dataanalysis from thisangle. When considering our neighborhoods and our borough, we wanted to primarily concentrate on correlations between price
and other factors.

### Some statistics... 

To first approach our data, we wanted to getan idea of some of the basic price statistics in our three data sets. We printed out the following:

```
Number of listings in all boroughs: 48895
Number of listings in Bronx: 1091
Number of listings in our Bronx neighborhoods: 225

Price stats in all boroughs:
Mean: 152.7206871868289
Max: 10000
Min: 0

Price stats in all Bronx neighborhoods:
Mean: 87.4967919340055
Max: 2500
Min: 0

Price stats in our Bronx neighborhoods:
Mean: 79.19111111111111
Max: 450
Min: 21
```
### Visuals, Visuals, Visuals

Now that we had the preliminary price information, we wanted to visualize this data we had collected.

## **_The Breakdown_**

The Bronx is an incredible borough on it's own, but a borough is really only as much as the sum of its parts! Each member of our team explored the statistics of Airbnb in four individual Bronx neighborhoods: **Kingsbridge, Fordham, Allerton, and Concourse.** Please click through to deep dive into each team member's project!
